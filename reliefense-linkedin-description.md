## LinkedIn Post Announcement (Optional but Recommended!)

### Post Text:

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: **ReliefSense** - an IoT Agriculture Dashboard

Over the past [timeframe], I built a full-stack web application to monitor agricultural conditions in real-time, designed for humanitarian and remote farming contexts.

ðŸ”§ **What I built:**
â€¢ React + TypeScript frontend with live sensor visualization
â€¢ Python Flask backend with RESTful API
â€¢ Real-time data streaming using WebSockets
â€¢ Mobile-responsive design with multi-language support
â€¢ Temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ monitoring across multiple nodes

ðŸ’¡ **What I learned:**
Working on this project deepened my understanding of real-time systems, secure API design, and building production-ready applications. It also reinforced the importance of accessibility and user-centered design.

ðŸ“ˆ **Technologies:** #React #TypeScript #Python #Flask #WebSockets #IoT #FullStack

This project builds on my experience with AWS deployment, Docker, and NGINX from my previous work at The Home Store, and applies the system administration skills I'm developing at Algonquin College.
