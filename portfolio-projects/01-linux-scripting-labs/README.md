# Linux Scripting Labs (CST8245)

> Bash scripting projects demonstrating Linux fundamentals, flow control, and input validation.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains practical Bash scripting projects completed during the CST8245 Linux Scripting course at Algonquin College. Each project demonstrates problem-solving skills, command-line proficiency, and understanding of core Linux concepts.

## 🎯 Projects Included

### 1. Parity Counter Script
- **Description**: Script that counts even and odd numbers from user input
- **Skills**: Input validation, conditional logic, loops
- **Location**: [parity-counter/](parity-counter/)

### 2. Number Guessing Game
- **Description**: Interactive game where the user guesses a random number with feedback
- **Skills**: Random number generation, nested loops, user interaction
- **Location**: [number-guessing-game/](number-guessing-game/)

### 3. Calculator with Validation
- **Description**: Command-line calculator with division-by-zero validation
- **Skills**: Arithmetic operations, error handling, input sanitization
- **Location**: [calculator/](calculator/)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Shell**: Bash
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian)
- **Tools**: vim, nano, chmod

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to any project folder
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

## 📚 What I Learned

These scripts taught me the fundamentals of Linux automation:

- **Writing maintainable Bash scripts** - I learned that clear variable names and comments make scripts easier to debug later
- **Input validation is critical** - Users will always enter unexpected data, so I built robust error handling into every script
- **Flow control mastery** - Nested if/else and while loops became second nature through these exercises
- **Linux permissions** - Understanding chmod and execution permissions was essential for making scripts work
- **Documentation matters** - Well-documented scripts are easier to maintain and share with others

### Why This Matters

At **Kelesoglu IT** (2017-2019), I did a lot of repetitive tasks manually - resetting passwords, checking disk space, creating user accounts. These Bash scripting skills would have saved me hours every week. Now I understand how to automate those tasks properly.

The calculator script's division-by-zero handling taught me an important lesson: **never trust user input**. This mindset carried over to my work at **OISO**, where I always validated form inputs to prevent errors.

## 👤 About This Project

**Created by**: Ahmet Mikail Bayindir
**Program**: Computer Systems Technician - Networking
**Institution**: Algonquin College
**Course**: CST8245 - Linux Scripting

### What I Built

I created three Bash scripts that solve real-world problems:
1. **Parity Counter** - Analyzes number patterns (useful for data validation)
2. **Number Guessing Game** - Interactive program demonstrating user feedback loops
3. **Calculator** - Practical tool with proper error handling

These aren't just academic exercises - they're building blocks for automation scripts I'll use throughout my IT career.
