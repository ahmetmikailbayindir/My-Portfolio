# Linux Scripting Labs (CST8245)

> Bash scripting projects demonstrating Linux fundamentals, flow control, and input validation.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains practical Bash scripting projects completed during the CST8245 Linux Scripting course at Algonquin College. Each project demonstrates problem-solving skills, command-line proficiency, and understanding of core Linux concepts.

## 🎯 Projects Included

### 1. Parity Counter Script
- **Description**: Script that counts even and odd numbers from user input
- **Skills**: Input validation, conditional logic, loops
- **Location**: [parity-counter/](parity-counter/)

### 2. Number Guessing Game
- **Description**: Interactive game where the user guesses a random number with feedback
- **Skills**: Random number generation, nested loops, user interaction
- **Location**: [number-guessing-game/](number-guessing-game/)

### 3. Calculator with Validation
- **Description**: Command-line calculator with division-by-zero validation
- **Skills**: Arithmetic operations, error handling, input sanitization
- **Location**: [calculator/](calculator/)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Shell**: Bash
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian)
- **Tools**: vim, nano, chmod

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to any project folder
3. Make the script executable:
