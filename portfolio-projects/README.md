## üéØ Why I Built This Portfolio

As a CST - Networking student, I wanted to showcase more than just course completion. This portfolio represents:

### 1. **My Actual Lab Work**
Every project here is something I've personally:
- Coded and debugged
- Configured and tested
- Documented and explained
- Learned from (including my mistakes!)

### 2. **My Learning Journey**
I didn't just complete assignments - I:
- Spent extra time understanding WHY things work
- Wrote detailed documentation for future reference
- Created reusable templates for common tasks
- Documented troubleshooting steps I wish I had when I started

### 3. **Skills I Can Apply Immediately**
These aren't theoretical exercises:
- The PowerShell script could provision users for a small business today
- The VLAN configurations follow enterprise networking standards
- The troubleshooting guides solve real problems I've encountered
- The ITSM documentation reflects industry practices

### 4. **My Approach to IT Work**
Through this portfolio, I demonstrate:
- **Problem-solving**: Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Documentation**: Making technical concepts accessible
- **Automation**: Finding efficient solutions to repetitive tasks
- **Continuous Learning**: Each project taught me something new

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üî• PowerShell Bulk User Creation Script
**Connects to my work experience**: At OISO, I managed Active Directory manually. This script automates what I used to do by hand.

**What it does**:
- Creates 50+ AD user accounts from CSV in under 2 minutes (vs 2 hours manually)
- Validates input, checks for duplicates, verifies OUs exist
- Provides detailed success/fail/skip reporting

**Why I built it**: After manually creating dozens of AD accounts at work, I learned PowerShell automation in CST8342 and immediately saw how much time this could save IT teams.

### üî• VLAN Configuration Lab
**Connects to my background**: At Kelesoglu IT, I maintained LAN/WAN networks. This formalizes that knowledge with Cisco standards.

**What it demonstrates**:
- Multi-VLAN network with proper department segmentation
- Router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing
- 802.1Q trunking configuration
- Complete verification testing

**Why it matters**: Network segmentation is critical for security and performance in enterprise environments - skills I'm building toward my CCNA.

### üî• BSOD Troubleshooting Guide
**Connects to my support experience**: With 95% first-time resolution at Kelesoglu and 100+ issues resolved at OISO, I've seen A LOT of BSODs.

**What it contains**:
- 12-step systematic troubleshooting process (based on real-world experience)
- Common error codes I've actually encountered
- Safe mode and driver management procedures
- Prevention tips learned the hard way
