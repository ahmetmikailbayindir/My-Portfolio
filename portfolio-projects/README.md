## üìÑ Repository Usage

This portfolio is organized as separate project folders. Each can be:
- Published as individual GitHub repositories
- Combined into a single portfolio repository
- Shared with potential employers
- Used as reference for future projects

### Publishing Strategy

**Option 1: Monorepo (Single Repository)**
- Keep all projects in this structure
- Easy to maintain and navigate
- Single link to share

**Option 2: Separate Repositories**
- Create individual repos for each project folder
- Better for showcasing specific skills
- Easier for others to clone individual projects

**Recommended**: Start with monorepo, then create separate repos for top 3-4 projects to pin on GitHub profile.
