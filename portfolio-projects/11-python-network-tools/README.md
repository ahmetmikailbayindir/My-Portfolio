# Python Network Tools - Automation & Analysis

> **Network automation with Python**: Practical tools for network analysis, monitoring, and automation

## üìã Project Overview

A collection of Python scripts that solve real networking problems - from subnet calculation to log analysis to automated configuration backups. These are the kinds of tools that make a network administrator's job easier.

**Why this matters**: Python is the language of network automation. Tools like Ansible, Nornir, and NAPALM are Python-based. This project shows I can script network tasks, not just use pre-built tools.

## üéØ Tools Included

1. **Subnet Calculator** - IP addressing and VLSM calculations
2. **Network Scanner** - Discover active hosts and open ports
3. **Log Analyzer** - Parse firewall/router logs for insights
4. **Config Backup** - Automated device configuration backups
5. **Bandwidth Monitor** - Track network utilization
6. **DNS Checker** - Verify DNS propagation across servers

## üìö What I Learned

### Python Skills I Developed

- **Standard library mastery** - `ipaddress` module handles subnet calculations elegantly, `socket` for network connections, `argparse` makes CLI tools professional, `re` for log parsing patterns
- **Third-party libraries** - `scapy` for packet crafting and network discovery, `paramiko` for SSH automation to Cisco/Linux devices. These are industry-standard tools
- **Concurrency with threading** - Port scanning 100 hosts sequentially takes forever. `ThreadPoolExecutor` parallelizes it - 50 seconds ‚Üí 5 seconds. Game changer for network tools
- **File I/O for real data** - Reading 100MB+ log files efficiently, writing structured backup files, handling file paths properly across OS platforms
- **Proper error handling** - Network tools face timeouts, connection refused, DNS failures constantly. Try/except blocks with specific exception types make tools robust

### Networking Concepts I Applied Through Code

- **Subnetting math programmatically** - Calculating network address, broadcast, usable range, prefix lengths. Writing Python code forced me to deeply understand the math
- **ARP protocol for host discovery** - Ping sweeps use ARP at Layer 2. Understanding this made me realize why ping works on local networks even if ICMP is blocked
- **TCP socket programming** - Opening connections to specific ports, setting timeouts, detecting open vs closed vs filtered ports. This is how `nmap` works under the hood
- **SSH automation with Paramiko** - Connecting to network devices, executing commands, retrieving configs. This is foundational for tools like Ansible
- **Log parsing with regex** - Extracting IP addresses, timestamps, error codes from unstructured logs. Regex patterns turn noise into actionable data

### Real-World Insights That Changed My Approach

- **Automation eliminates human error** - At Kelesoglu IT, I manually calculated subnets for new network segments. Mistakes meant redoing IP assignments. Automation makes it foolproof
- **Threading is essential for network tools** - First version scanned ports sequentially. Unusably slow. Threading made it 10x faster. Network tools MUST be concurrent
- **Error handling makes or breaks tools** - Network conditions are unpredictable. Tools that crash on timeout are useless. Graceful failure handling is critical
- **Never hardcode credentials** - First version had SSH passwords in code. Terrible security. Environment variables + SSH keys solved it properly
- **Self-documenting CLIs** - `argparse` generates help text automatically. Users (including future me) need clear usage instructions

### Why This Project Matters to Me

**At OISO** (2023-2024) and **Kelesoglu IT** (2017-2019), I performed these tasks manually:
- **Subnet calculations** - Used online calculators or did math on paper. Slow and error-prone
- **Port scanning** - Manually tried connections or used nmap without understanding what it did
- **Log analysis** - Grepped through logs line-by-line looking for patterns. Missed things
- **Config backups** - SSHed into each device manually, copied configs. Forgot devices sometimes

These Python tools automate what I used to do manually. More importantly, **building them taught me how the underlying protocols work**:
- Writing a port scanner taught me TCP handshakes and socket states
- Writing a subnet calculator forced me to understand CIDR and binary math
- Writing a log analyzer taught me regex and pattern matching
- Writing SSH automation taught me Paramiko and network device management

**Python is the language of network automation**. Ansible is Python. Network monitoring tools use Python. Learning to write these tools makes me a better network technician because I understand what's happening under the hood.

## üéØ Real-World Application

**These tools solve actual problems**:
- **Subnet Calculator**: Planning IP addressing for new networks
- **Network Scanner**: Discovering unauthorized devices
- **Log Analyzer**: Identifying security threats and attack patterns
- **Config Backup**: Disaster recovery and audit compliance

**Skills directly applicable to**:
- Network automation with Ansible (Python-based)
- Writing custom monitoring scripts
- Security automation (log analysis, threat hunting)
- DevOps tooling (infrastructure as code)

## üîó Connection to My Experience & Courses

**From CST8324 (Programming Fundamentals)**:
- Learned Python basics, data structures, algorithms
- These tools apply programming to networking problems

**From CST8371/8323 (Networking & Security)**:
- Understand IP addressing, port scanning, log analysis
- Python automates what I'd otherwise do manually

**From my IT experience**:
- At OISO/Kelesoglu, I troubleshot networks manually
- These tools would have made my job 10x faster
