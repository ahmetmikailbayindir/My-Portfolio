## üìö What I Learned

### Networking Concepts
I finally understood the fundamentals that make networks work:
- **OSI and TCP/IP models** - Not just memorization, but understanding why each layer exists and how to troubleshoot at each level
- **Switching vs routing** - Layer 2 moves frames based on MAC addresses, Layer 3 routes packets based on IP addresses
- **Collision and broadcast domains** - Understanding these helped me design networks that don't bring themselves down with traffic
- **MAC address tables and ARP** - The magic behind how devices actually find each other on a network

### Cisco IOS Configuration
I got hands-on with real Cisco commands:
- **CLI navigation** - I can now navigate between user mode, privileged mode, and config mode without thinking
- **Interface configuration** - Assigning IPs, enabling interfaces, setting descriptions
- **Routing protocols** - I configured static routes, RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP (OSPF is my favorite - fast convergence)
- **VLAN creation** - Segmenting networks logically instead of buying more physical switches
- **802.1Q trunking** - Carrying multiple VLANs across a single link

### Network Design
I learned to design networks like an architect:
- **Hierarchical design** - Core, distribution, and access layers make networks scalable
- **Subnetting and VLSM** - Efficient IP allocation instead of wasting addresses
- **Redundancy and convergence** - Backup paths so one failure doesn't kill the network
- **Scalability** - Designing for future growth, not just today's needs

### Troubleshooting Methodology
I developed a systematic approach:
- **Layered troubleshooting** - Start at Layer 1 (cables), work up to Layer 7 (application)
- **Show commands** - `show ip interface brief`, `show vlan brief`, `show ip route` became second nature
- **Packet capture** - Using Wireshark to see exactly what's happening on the wire
- **Common mistakes** - Wrong subnet masks, missing default gateways, VLAN mismatches

### Why This Matters

At **OISO** (2023-2024), we had network connectivity issues between departments. Understanding VLANs and inter-VLAN routing helped me diagnose that the router wasn't configured properly for VLAN 20. Before this course, I wouldn't have known where to start.

At **Kelesoglu IT** (2017-2019), we ran a flat network - everything in one broadcast domain. I didn't know any better at the time. Now I understand why that's a bad idea: broadcast storms, no traffic segmentation, and security risks. VLANs would have solved all of that.

### Real-World Impact

The subnetting skills saved me countless hours. Instead of using calculators or guessing, I can now:
- Calculate subnet masks in my head for common scenarios
- Design IP addressing schemes that don't overlap
- Allocate exactly the right number of IPs per department (not wasting /24s on 10-host networks)

## üìä Subnetting Example

**Scenario**: Design network for company with 4 departments

| Department | Hosts Required | Network Address | Subnet Mask | Usable Range |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Sales | 50 | 192.168.1.0/26 | 255.255.255.192 | .1 - .62 |
| IT | 25 | 192.168.1.64/27 | 255.255.255.224 | .65 - .94 |
| HR | 10 | 192.168.1.96/28 | 255.255.255.240 | .97 - .110 |
| Management | 5 | 192.168.1.112/29 | 255.255.255.248 | .113 - .118 |

## üîç Sample Configurations

### VLAN Configuration (Switch)
```cisco
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name Sales
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# interface FastEthernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
```

### Inter-VLAN Routing (Router)
```cisco
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0.10
Router(config-subif)# encapsulation dot1Q 10
Router(config-subif)# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
```

### OSPF Configuration
```cisco
Router(config)# router ospf 1
Router(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
Router(config-router)# passive-interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
```

## üß™ Verification Commands Used

```cisco
show ip interface brief       # Interface status and IPs
show vlan brief              # VLAN assignments
show ip route                # Routing table
show running-config          # Current configuration
show interfaces trunk        # Trunk status
ping [destination]           # Connectivity test
traceroute [destination]     # Path verification
```

**Course**: CST8371 - Networking Fundamentals

### What I Built

I built comprehensive networking labs covering:
- **Multi-VLAN networks** with router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing
- **VLSM subnetting designs** for efficient IP allocation across departments
- **Dynamic routing** implementations using RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP
- **VMware virtual networking** comparing NAT vs bridged modes
- **Troubleshooting scenarios** practicing systematic problem-solving

These labs taught me to think like a network engineer - not just following commands, but understanding **why** networks work the way they do.

### Skills I Can Apply Immediately

After completing these labs, I can:
- Design and subnet enterprise networks from scratch
- Configure Cisco routers and switches via CLI
- Troubleshoot connectivity issues systematically (Layer 1 through Layer 7)
- Implement VLANs for network segmentation and security
- Set up dynamic routing protocols for redundancy
- Document network configurations professionally

This is CCNA-level knowledge - the industry standard for networking professionals.
