# VLAN Configuration & Inter-VLAN Routing Lab

## üéØ Objective

Configure VLANs on a Cisco switch and implement inter-VLAN routing using the **router-on-a-stick** method to allow communication between different VLANs.

| Device | Interface | IP Address | Subnet Mask | VLAN | Default Gateway |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|------|----------------|
| Router0 | G0/0.10 | 192.168.10.1 | 255.255.255.0 | 10 | N/A |
| Router0 | G0/0.20 | 192.168.20.1 | 255.255.255.0 | 20 | N/A |
| PC1 | NIC | 192.168.10.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 10 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC2 | NIC | 192.168.10.11 | 255.255.255.0 | 10 | 192.168.10.1 |
| PC3 | NIC | 192.168.20.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 20 | 192.168.20.1 |
| PC4 | NIC | 192.168.20.11 | 255.255.255.0 | 20 | 192.168.20.1 |

## üîß Configuration Steps

### 1. Switch Configuration

**Create VLANs:**
```cisco
vlan 10
 name Sales
vlan 20
 name IT
```

**Assign ports to VLANs:**
```cisco
interface range FastEthernet 0/1-2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10

interface range FastEthernet 0/3-4
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
```

**Configure trunk to router:**
```cisco
interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

### 2. Router Configuration (Router-on-a-Stick)

**Enable main interface:**
```cisco
interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
 no shutdown
```

**Create sub-interfaces for each VLAN:**
```cisco
interface GigabitEthernet 0/0.10
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

interface GigabitEthernet 0/0.20
 encapsulation dot1Q 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
```

## ‚úÖ Verification & Testing

### Verification Commands

**On Switch:**
```cisco
show vlan brief              # Verify VLAN creation and assignments
show interfaces trunk        # Verify trunk configuration
show running-config          # Review full configuration
```

**On Router:**
```cisco
show ip interface brief      # Verify sub-interfaces are up
show ip route                # Check routing table (should show connected networks)
show running-config          # Review configuration
```

### Test Connectivity

**From PC1 (VLAN 10):**
```
ping 192.168.10.11    # PC2 (same VLAN) - Should succeed (Layer 2 switching)
ping 192.168.20.10    # PC3 (different VLAN) - Should succeed (Layer 3 routing)
tracert 192.168.20.10 # Should show hop through router (192.168.10.1)
```

## üìö Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. VLANs (Virtual LANs)
- **Purpose**: Segment broadcast domains logically (not physically)
- **Benefit**: Improved security, reduced broadcast traffic, logical grouping
- **VLAN 10 (Sales)**: Contains PC1 and PC2
- **VLAN 20 (IT)**: Contains PC3 and PC4

### 2. Trunk Links (802.1Q)
- Carries traffic for multiple VLANs between switch and router
- Uses VLAN tagging to identify which VLAN each frame belongs to
- Command: `switchport mode trunk`

### 3. Router-on-a-Stick
- Single physical router interface with multiple logical sub-interfaces
- Each sub-interface acts as default gateway for one VLAN
- **Advantage**: Cost-effective (only need one router interface)
- **Disadvantage**: Potential bottleneck (all traffic uses one link)

### 4. Inter-VLAN Routing
- **Problem**: Devices in different VLANs can't communicate by default
- **Solution**: Route traffic between VLANs using router
- Traffic flow: PC1 ‚Üí Switch ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Switch ‚Üí PC3

## üîç How It Works

1. **Intra-VLAN Communication** (PC1 to PC2):
   - Layer 2 switching only
   - Traffic stays within VLAN 10
   - No router involvement

2. **Inter-VLAN Communication** (PC1 to PC3):
   - PC1 sends packet to default gateway (192.168.10.1)
   - Switch forwards to router via trunk (tagged as VLAN 10)
   - Router receives on sub-interface G0/0.10
   - Router routes to G0/0.20 (VLAN 20)
   - Switch receives packet (tagged as VLAN 20)
   - Switch forwards to PC3 in VLAN 20

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| No intra-VLAN communication | Incorrect VLAN assignment | Check `show vlan brief` |
| No inter-VLAN communication | Router interface down | `no shutdown` on G0/0 |
| Trunk not working | VLAN not allowed on trunk | `switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20` |
| Sub-interface down | Missing encapsulation | Add `encapsulation dot1Q [vlan-id]` |
| Wrong gateway | PC misconfigured | Verify default gateway matches sub-interface IP |

## üìä Expected Results

‚úÖ **Layer 2 Communication**: PCs in same VLAN communicate directly via switch
‚úÖ **Layer 3 Routing**: PCs in different VLANs communicate through router
‚úÖ **Trunk Functionality**: Single link carries multiple VLAN traffic
‚úÖ **Scalability**: Easy to add more VLANs with additional sub-interfaces
