## üéØ Common Troubleshooting Methodology

### Step 1: Identify the Problem
- Gather information from user
- Observe symptoms and error messages
- Review recent changes (software, hardware, updates)

### Step 2: Research & Hypothesize
- Check error codes/messages
- Consult documentation
- Form theory of probable cause

### Step 3: Test & Implement
- Test hypothesis with least invasive solution first
- Document steps taken
- Implement fix

### Step 4: Verify & Document
- Confirm issue is resolved
- Test all functionality
- Document solution for future reference

## üìä Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Slow Windows 10 Performance
**Symptoms**: Sluggish startup, high disk usage, frozen applications

**Solution Path**:
1. Check Task Manager ‚Üí Disk usage at 100%
2. Identify Windows Search Indexer as culprit
3. Rebuild search index or disable for non-essential drives
4. Verify improvement with Performance Monitor

### Scenario 2: Linux System Won't Boot After Update
**Symptoms**: GRUB rescue prompt, kernel panic

**Solution Path**:
1. Boot from live USB
2. Mount system partition
3. Chroot into system
4. Reinstall GRUB bootloader
5. Update GRUB configuration
6. Reboot and verify

## üéì What I Learned

### Technical Skills I Developed

- **Systematic troubleshooting** - I learned to follow a logical process instead of randomly trying fixes
- **OS-specific diagnostic tools** - Event Viewer for Windows, dmesg for Linux, Console for MacOS
- **Hardware diagnostics** - Identifying failing RAM, dying hard drives, thermal issues before they cause data loss
- **Command-line mastery** - `sfc /scannow`, `DISM`, `fsck`, `chkdsk` became part of my troubleshooting toolkit
- **Data backup and recovery** - Always backup first, because troubleshooting can sometimes make things worse

### Professional Skills That Transfer Everywhere

- **Technical writing clarity** - Writing guides that non-technical users can follow
- **IEEE documentation standards** - Professional formatting that looks polished
- **Breaking down complexity** - Explaining technical problems in plain language
- **Customer service mindset** - Understanding that frustrated users need patience and clear guidance
- **Time management** - Prioritizing critical issues (data loss) over minor annoyances (slow startup)

### Why This Course Was Critical

At **OISO** (2023-2024), I dealt with support tickets daily. This course taught me to:
- **Document solutions properly** so I don't have to re-solve the same problem next week
- **Use Event Viewer** to diagnose Windows BSODs instead of guessing
- **Fix boot issues** without reinstalling the entire OS

At **Kelesoglu IT** (2017-2019), I learned hardware troubleshooting through trial and error. This course formalized that knowledge:
- **POST codes** tell you exactly what's failing during boot
- **MemTest86** definitively proves whether RAM is bad
- **SMART errors** warn you before hard drives completely fail

### Real Problems I Can Now Solve

1. **Windows won't boot** ‚Üí I know how to use Startup Repair, rebuild BCD, and restore from System Restore
2. **Linux kernel panic** ‚Üí I can chroot from live USB and fix GRUB
3. **Mac stuck on Apple logo** ‚Üí NVRAM reset, safe boot, recovery mode - I know the progression
4. **Random BSODs** ‚Üí Event Viewer + error codes lead me straight to the driver or hardware causing crashes
5. **Slow performance** ‚Üí Task Manager + Performance Monitor show me exactly what's bottlenecking

This isn't theory - these are issues I encountered at OISO, and now I have documented procedures for solving them.

## üë§ About This Project

**Created by**: Ahmet Mikail Bayindir
**Program**: Computer Systems Technician - Networking
**Institution**: Algonquin College
**Course**: CST8316 - PC Troubleshooting

### What I Built

I created a comprehensive troubleshooting knowledge base covering:
- **Hardware diagnostics** - Boot failures, RAM issues, hard drive failures, thermal problems
- **Windows troubleshooting** - BSODs, boot repair, performance optimization, network issues
- **Linux troubleshooting** - GRUB repair, package management, permissions
- **MacOS troubleshooting** - Boot issues, application crashes

These aren't just guides I copied from the internet. I wrote them based on problems I actually solved in labs and real-world experience. Each guide follows professional IEEE documentation standards because that's how real IT departments document procedures.

### Why Documentation Matters

At OISO, we didn't have good documentation. Every time someone encountered a problem, they'd ask around or Google it again. I wasted hours re-solving problems I'd already fixed before.

Now I understand: **good documentation turns every problem you solve into knowledge the whole team can use**. That's why I structured these guides with clear symptoms, step-by-step solutions, verification steps, and prevention tips.
