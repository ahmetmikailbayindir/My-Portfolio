## üèóÔ∏è ITIL Framework Overview

### Core ITSM Processes Covered

#### 1. Incident Management
**Goal**: Restore normal service operation as quickly as possible

**Key Steps**:
- Incident detection and recording
- Categorization and prioritization
- Investigation and diagnosis
- Resolution and recovery
- Incident closure

**Metrics**: MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve), First Call Resolution Rate

#### 2. Problem Management
**Goal**: Prevent incidents from happening and minimize impact of unavoidable incidents

**Key Steps**:
- Problem identification
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Known Error Database (KEDB) maintenance
- Workaround implementation
- Permanent solution development

#### 3. Change Management
**Goal**: Ensure changes are recorded, evaluated, approved, and reviewed in a controlled manner

**Key Steps**:
- Request for Change (RFC)
- Change assessment and approval
- Change implementation
- Post-implementation review (PIR)

**Change Types**:
- Standard (pre-approved)
- Normal (requires approval)
- Emergency (expedited process)

#### 4. Service Request Management
**Goal**: Handle user requests for service in an efficient and user-friendly manner

**Examples**:
- Password resets
- Software installation requests
- Access rights requests
- Hardware provisioning

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Service Desk Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **MTTR** | Mean Time to Resolve | < 4 hours |
| **FCR** | First Call Resolution Rate | > 75% |
| **CSAT** | Customer Satisfaction Score | > 85% |
| **Ticket Backlog** | Number of open tickets | < 50 |
| **SLA Compliance** | % of tickets meeting SLA | > 95% |

### Change Management Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Change Success Rate** | % of changes without incidents | > 95% |
| **Emergency Changes** | % of emergency changes | < 10% |
| **CAB Meeting Frequency** | Weekly/Bi-weekly | Weekly |

## üîç Case Study Example: Major Incident Response

### Scenario
**Company**: Mid-sized e-commerce platform
**Issue**: Complete website outage during Black Friday
**Impact**: 5000+ customers unable to purchase, $50,000/hour revenue loss

### Response Process

**1. Detection & Escalation (0-5 minutes)**
- Monitoring system alerts service desk
- Ticket automatically logged as P1 Critical
- Major Incident Manager (MIM) notified
- Emergency response team assembled

**2. Initial Assessment (5-15 minutes)**
- MIM opens war room (conference bridge)
- Technical team investigates root cause
- Communications team prepares customer notification
- Management team notified

**3. Diagnosis (15-45 minutes)**
- Database server identified as issue (disk failure)
- Failover to backup server initiated
- Data integrity checks performed

**4. Resolution (45-60 minutes)**
- Traffic redirected to backup infrastructure
- Website functionality restored
- Monitoring confirms normal operations

**5. Post-Incident Review (Next business day)**
- Root Cause Analysis conducted
- Timeline documented
- Lessons learned identified:
  - Improve monitoring for disk health
  - Reduce failover time (currently 30 min ‚Üí target 5 min)
  - Enhance customer communication templates

### Lessons Learned & Actions
- ‚úÖ Implement proactive SMART monitoring
- ‚úÖ Automate failover procedures
- ‚úÖ Create pre-approved customer communication templates
- ‚úÖ Schedule quarterly disaster recovery drills

## üìù SLA (Service Level Agreement) Example

### Priority Matrix

| Priority | Description | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Complete service outage | 15 minutes | 4 hours |
| **P2 - High** | Major functionality impaired | 1 hour | 8 hours |
| **P3 - Medium** | Minor functionality issue | 4 hours | 2 business days |
| **P4 - Low** | General inquiry/request | 1 business day | 5 business days |

### Escalation Path
```
Level 1: Service Desk (0-30 min)
    ‚Üì (If unresolved)
Level 2: Technical Support (30 min - 2 hours)
    ‚Üì (If unresolved)
Level 3: Senior Engineers (2+ hours)
    ‚Üì (If critical)
Management Escalation (Major Incidents)
```
