# Linux Server Monitoring & Automation

> **Production-ready monitoring solution**: Automated system health checks with alerting for Linux servers

## üìã Project Overview

A comprehensive Bash-based monitoring system that tracks server health metrics and sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded. This is the kind of tool that prevents small issues from becoming major outages.

**Why I built this**: At OISO, we had servers go down because no one noticed disk space filling up. This monitoring system would have prevented that. It's proactive IT - catching problems before users notice them.

## üéØ Problem Statement

**Real-world scenario**: You manage 5-10 Linux servers. You need to know IMMEDIATELY if:
- Disk space exceeds 85%
- CPU usage stays above 90% for 5+ minutes
- Memory usage exceeds 90%
- Critical services stop running (Apache, MySQL, SSH)
- System load average is dangerously high
- Suspicious login attempts detected

Without monitoring, you find out when users complain. With monitoring, you fix it before they notice.

## üõ†Ô∏è What This System Does

### Core Monitoring Features

1. **Disk Space Monitoring**
   - Checks all mounted filesystems
   - Alerts when usage > 85% (warning) or > 95% (critical)
   - Identifies what's consuming space

2. **CPU & Load Monitoring**
   - Tracks per-core CPU usage
   - Monitors system load average (1min, 5min, 15min)
   - Alerts when load exceeds number of cores

3. **Memory & Swap Monitoring**
   - Real-time RAM usage percentage
   - Swap usage tracking
   - Identifies top memory-consuming processes

4. **Service Health Checks**
   - Verifies critical services are running
   - Monitors service restart counts
   - Checks listening ports

5. **Security Monitoring**
   - Failed SSH login attempts
   - New user accounts created
   - Sudo command usage
   - Unusual system file modifications

6. **Network Connectivity**
   - Ping tests to gateway and external hosts
   - DNS resolution checks
   - Bandwidth usage tracking

#!/bin/bash
# Analyzes system-monitor.log to show trends

LOG_FILE="/var/log/system-monitor.log"

echo "=== Alert Summary (Last 24 Hours) ==="
grep -E '\[WARN\]|\[CRIT\]' $LOG_FILE | grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" | \
    awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

echo ""
echo "=== Most Common Alerts ==="

echo ""
echo "=== Critical Alerts (Last Week) ==="
grep '\[CRIT\]' $LOG_FILE | tail -20
```

## üß™ Testing the Monitoring System

### Simulate Alerts for Testing

**1. Test disk alert:**
```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/testfile bs=1M count=10000  # Create 10GB file
```

**2. Test CPU alert:**
```bash
yes > /dev/null &  # Spawn CPU-intensive process
# Kill with: killall yes
```

**3. Test memory alert:**
```bash
stress --vm 2 --vm-bytes 1G --timeout 60s
```

**4. Test service alert:**
```bash
systemctl stop apache2  # Stop service to trigger alert
```

## üìö What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- **Bash scripting at scale**: Managing complex logic, error handling
- **System metrics collection**: Understanding /proc filesystem, system calls
- **Email/webhook integration**: Sending programmatic alerts
- **Cron job management**: Scheduling, logging, handling failures
- **Log rotation**: Preventing logs from filling disk

### Operational Skills
- **Alert fatigue prevention**: Setting appropriate thresholds (not too sensitive)
- **Actionable alerts**: Including context (top processes) in notifications
- **Automatic remediation**: Restarting services automatically when safe
- **Documentation**: Clear runbook for alert responses

### Real-World Insights
- **Monitoring is proactive IT**: Better to catch issues at 3 AM via alert than at 9 AM via angry users
- **Context matters**: "Disk full" alert needs to say WHERE and top space consumers
- **False positives kill trust**: Spent time tuning thresholds to avoid boy-who-cried-wolf
- **Start simple, iterate**: Began with just disk monitoring, added features based on actual needs

## üéØ Real-World Application

**Who needs this:**
- Small businesses without expensive monitoring tools (Nagios, Datadog)
- Home lab enthusiasts managing multiple servers
- Entry-level sysadmins building their first monitoring system
- Dev/test environments where commercial tools are overkill

**Production-ready for:**
- 5-20 Linux servers
- Non-mission-critical applications
- Internal tools and development environments
- Budget-conscious IT departments

**When to upgrade to commercial tools:**
- 20+ servers (need centralized monitoring)
- Compliance requirements (audit trails, SOC2)
- Need for dashboards and historical graphs
- Multiple alert channels and on-call rotations

## üîó Connection to My Experience

**At OISO**: We had a file server run out of disk space, causing email delivery failures. Users couldn't send/receive for 2 hours before IT noticed. This monitoring system would have alerted us when disk hit 85%, giving time to clean up before the outage.

**At Kelesoglu IT**: I responded to "server is slow" tickets reactively. With proactive monitoring, I could have seen CPU spikes or memory leaks developing and fixed them before users complained.

**In my CST program**: I learned Linux administration, but monitoring is the operational skill that keeps systems running. This project bridges classroom knowledge and real IT operations.
